This repository holds all of the documentation for the AboutTheMusic Web application.

### Problem Statement

For guitar players interested in the musical composition and theory behind the songs they play, its difficult to find the relevant musical data they seek
without buying sheet music, performing multiple Internet searches, or scrolling through an online encyclopedia like Wikipedia.  
Instead of searching and gathering all of this musical data from multiple places, the AboutTheMusic app will bring it all into one resource.
AboutTheMusic will provide a quick reference point where guitarists and musicians alike can find a song's musical key, the time signature,
common chord progressions, beats per minute, or familiar scale(s) used, among other pertinent song information.
